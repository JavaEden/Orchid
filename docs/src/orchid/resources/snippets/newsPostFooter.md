Are you interested in getting started with Orchid? There simply is no better way to manage all the documentation for 
your project, and I'd love to help you get set up! 

If you have an open-source project that needs docs, are building a new portfolio, or are building any other kind of 
static site, I want to work with you to get you set up with Orchid! Comment on this post, send me a PM here on Dev.to, 
reach out on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/JavaEden/Orchid), or [contact me here](https://www.caseyjbrooks.com/contact/) 
and I will be with you every step of the way.

And as always, let me know if you start using Orchid so I can feature you in the next update!
