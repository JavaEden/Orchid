## Breaking Changes

This release includes 1 major breaking change to end-users, and the deprecation of several other end-user features which
will be removed in a future release:

- The `--experimentalSourceDoc` is no longer needed, as experiemental SourceDocs are now the default functionality. If 
    you are still using the legacy sourcedocs, you can still use them for a short time longer, but you must now add the 
    `--legacySourceDoc` flag to Orchid. Sites still building docs on legacy SourceDocs will not work without that flag, 
    but you must now migrate to the new SourceDocs. Legacy sourcedocs will be removed entirely in the next major 
    release.
- `{% styles %}` is now included within the `{% head %}` template tag. The `{% styles %}` tag now does nothing, and in 
    the next major version will be removed, causing template errors.
- `{% scripts %}` has been replaced by the  `{% body %}` and `{% endbody %}` template tags. `{% scripts %}` will be 
    removed in the next major version, causing template errors.

In additional, there are several changes to both internal and public code APIs. The following are only of importance to
developers making custom Orchid plugins, but can be ignored by anyone else as they do not impact end-user functionality.

- The signature for `fun loadAssets()` in themes, pages, and components has been changed to 
    `loadAssets(delegate: AssetManagerDelegate)`. 
    - In `loadAssets`, calls to `addCss` and `addJs` should now be made on that delegate: `delegate.addCss("...")`, 
        `delegate.addJs("...")`.
    - Previously, custom code needed to be written to prevent some external assets from being downloaded, but now the 
        `addCss` and `addJs` methods accept a configuration lambda or object with these available options. They are the 
        same options available to `extraCss` and `extraJs`, so there is now difference between assets loaded in 
        `loadAssets()` or attached from the extra assets.
- OrchidTest methods for directly selecting and testing HTML have been removed. Instead, you should use the 
    `htmlHeadMatches` and `htmlBodyMatches` methods to build DOM subtrees. However, diagnostic output is greatly 
    improved for these matchers. 
- Meta-components can now render content to the page head, or the start or end of the HTML body. This is currently only 
    reserved for future use with official Orchid plugins, but may be of interest to develoers making custom plugins in 
    the Orchid community.
